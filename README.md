# MIPS 32-Bit Processor Design in Logism

## Overview
### My partner and I implemented our design for a five stage pipelined MIPS CPU into Logisim. This processor is capable of handling data and control hazards and it executes MIPS instructions to perform immediate arithmetic, register arithmetic, moves, shifts, immediate loads, jumps, branches, and memory stores.
