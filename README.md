# MIPS 32-Bit CPU
My personal implementation of a five stage pipelined MIPS CPU with forwarding in Logisim. This simulated processor is capable of handling data and control hazards and executes MIPS instructions to perform immediate arithmetic, register arithmetic, moves, shifts, immediate loads, jumps, branches, and memory stores. Created for CS 3410: Computer System Organization and Programming at Cornell University.
