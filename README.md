# MIPS 32-Bit Processor Design in Logism
### Implementation of a five stage pipelined MIPS CPU with forwarding into Logisim. This processor is capable of handling data and control hazards, and executes MIPS instructions to perform immediate arithmetic, register arithmetic, moves, shifts, immediate loads, jumps, branches, and memory stores.
